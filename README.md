# RAGArch: Optimize & Generate RAG Pipelines with Ease

RAGArch is a Streamlit-based application that empowers users to experiment with various components and parameters of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, providing a platform for easy optimization and code generation for your custom configurations.

## Features

- **Interactive UI:** Test different RAG pipeline components through an intuitive web interface.
- **Custom Configurations:** Choose from various Language Models, Embedding Models, Node Parsers, Response Synthesis Methods, and Vector Stores.
- **Live Testing:** Upload your data and immediately see how your RAG pipeline performs.
- **Code Generation:** Generate and export the Python code for your configured pipeline with a single click.

## How to Use

1. **Set Up Your Environment:**
   Ensure you have Python and Streamlit installed. Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

2. **Launch the Application:**
   Run the app with Streamlit:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Configure Your Pipeline:**
   - Upload your data file.
   - Select your preferred Language Model, Embedding Model, and other pipeline components.
   - Click "Generate RAG Pipeline" to test the pipeline with your data.

4. **Generate Code:**
   After testing, click "Generate Code Snippet" to receive the Python code for your custom configuration.
